### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd hire-overseases-test
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
```

4. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## How to Use

## Design Decisions

1. **State Management**: Used Zustand for lightweight, simple state management without the overhead of Redux
2. **API Routes**: Next.js API routes for server-side OpenAI API calls to keep API keys secure
3. **Model Choice**: Using `gpt-4o-mini` for cost-effectiveness while maintaining quality
4. **UI/UX**: Clean, modern interface with Tailwind CSS for rapid development and responsive design
5. **Auto-completion**: Interview can auto-complete when AI detects natural conclusion, or manually ended by user

## Deployment

This application can be deployed on:
- **Vercel** (recommended for Next.js)
- **Netlify**
- **Railway**
- Any platform supporting Next.js

Make sure to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable in your deployment platform.

## Notes

- The application uses OpenAI's API for conversation, text-to-speech, and speech-to-text, so you'll need an active OpenAI API key
- API keys should never be committed to the repository
- Speech-to-text uses OpenAI Whisper API (works in all modern browsers)
- The interview flow is designed to be flexible - recruiters can end interviews at any time
- Assessment is generated automatically when the interview ends
- Voice responses are automatically played when AI responds
- OpenAI TTS uses the "alloy" voice by default (can be changed in `/app/api/tts/route.ts`)
